# Interview project

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

I interviewed a student and they told me about their daily experiences with thier computer. They said that they really utilized google calender and scheduling their day/week/semester with orgainizational tools. A language might be helpful to help students schedule out their semester.

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

My idea will meet the needs of students and anyone who schedules their time on their computer. It will make adding, removing and editing events a simple task that can all be done in one place. Currently, as a google calender user, I have to manually input each event into the calender which can become tedious when I have multiple similar events (study times) to enter at once. If I am able to help, one would be able to easily enter events into ther calender by simply typing the event name and all of the time blocks that they would want it to fill.

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate for my users as it will allow for them to quickly adjust thier calander/daily schedule. My DSL will be conventional and simple to use, making everything clear and easy to work with to imporve a user who wants to schedule their time.

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I'm excited by this idea because it is something that I would actually use and I know other people who would benefit from it too. I came up with the idea after interviewing a CMC environmental science major.

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Easy full semester time management

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

The user would interact with the language by selecting the day they want to edit and either add or remove schedule items. Ideally the calander would be viewed in months (thats how I view my time management) and would help students visualize and map out thier semester. Programming would look like users editing, adding and checking things off their calander. The right way to interact with the probelem domain would be to input items into the calender as soon as one knows about them, my DSL will hopfully be so easy to use that this task will nake nearly no time at all.

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

When the proram runs it displays a calender with the users inputed items. The program interacts with the use by prompting them with an item they want to add, move, delete, or check off. Errors might occur if there are two of the same item on the same day or the day is in the past. They will be communicated to the user with a message after they input the request.

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to add/remove things. I think it will be much harder to create the calender interface, but it should be very possible. And it would be extremly hard to sync it to other services such as google calender.

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

There are other services like it but no clear and reputable DSLs that I could find. This is likely because applications exist that many users use and are comfortable using. They address the need relativly well but I want to make my DSL more suited toward the student.

A cool side idea, teachers could give students a file with the semester's assignments contained in it written in the langage of my DSL. Then students could directly copy the contents into the calender without having to manually input it themselves, 

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I would say %50/%50

However, I could create the language seperate from the system and do that later

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

I think this is a solid project idea for this course. Not too big. Seems achievable 

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

This is a good idea for a project because it is something I would actually use, often. It would allow me to create my own DSL and create a product I can hopefully share with others too. It might not be a good idea because it will require me to work a decent amount on the systems side of things which is not the main focus of this class. Also, many people are comfortable and used to using exisitng scheduling systems.
